## Unraveling the AI Whisper: My Adventure Building a Game with Amazon Q CLI

The moment I saw the "Build Games with Amazon Q CLI" challenge, I was intrigued. The premise? Use Amazon's generative AI-powered command-line assistant, Amazon Q CLI, to help build a game. As a developer always keen to explore new tools, especially those involving AI, I jumped at the opportunity. My game of choice? The unique text-based decryption puzzle: **The Whispering Gallery!**

## Why The Whispering Gallery?
- **Classic Appeal (with a Twist):** Combines the satisfaction of solving a puzzle with the urgency of a typing challenge, appealing to both logic and speed.
- **Web-Friendly:** Building it as a web game (HTML, CSS, JS) allowed for an interactive UI without complex graphics frameworks. Perfect for showcasing Q CLI's assistance with web fundamentals.
- **Iterative Design:** The "whisper" changing its scrambling pattern each round offered a clear path for iterative development, starting simple and adding complexity with Q CLI's help.

My vision was a clean, responsive web-based game where players quickly decipher scrambled phrases or fill in missing letters, with the "whisper" keeping them on their toes by subtly altering the rules each round.

## Features
- **Dynamic Whisper Patterns:** Each round, the phrase is scrambled in a new wayâ€”sometimes letters are shuffled, sometimes letters are missing, sometimes both!
- **Fast-Paced Rounds:** Players have 10 rounds to score as high as possible.
- **Clean, Responsive UI:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a smooth experience on desktop and mobile.
- **Replayable:** The randomization and pattern changes keep the game fresh.

## How to Play
1. A scrambled or incomplete phrase appears on the screen.
2. Type the correct phrase in the input box and submit.
3. The game tells you if you're right or wrong, then moves to the next round.
4. After 10 rounds, see your final score and try again!

## How Amazon Q CLI Helped
Amazon Q CLI was my coding companion throughout this project:
- **Boilerplate Generation:** Quickly scaffolded HTML, CSS, and JS files.
- **Algorithm Brainstorming:** Helped design and refine the scrambling ("whisper") logic.
- **DOM Manipulation:** Provided code snippets for updating the UI and handling user input.
- **Iterative Development:** Enabled rapid prototyping and testing of new features and patterns.
